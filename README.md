# FlashCards part 1

In this project, you will be creating a web app for flashcards! You can choose pairs of items to store in a flashcard-like format that users can then use to study, learn something new, or play a guessing game. Users will be able to study cards in a randomized order.

In the second part of this project next week, you will extend the web app to allow users to enter an answer (with exact or fuzzy matching), and move backwards and forwards through the list of cards.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
